I am currently a Research Assistant working with the [FoRTE Reasearch Group](https://github.com/FoRTE-Research) group at Virginia Tech. I'm working under [Matthew Hicks](http://www.impedimenttoprogress.com/), who works on various projects, broadly associated with systems, security and architecture. Before this, I was working with the Systems group at The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) in Pakistan. Apart from that, I'm also a teaching assistant. I've taught various courses including Introduction to Programming, Operating Systems and Network Centric Computing. I'm current a TA for Professionalism in Computing.

Research Interests and Projects
======
Broadly, I am interested in working with systems, security and compilers. Currently, I am working on providing compiler support for intermittent computation on energy harvesting devices using LLVM. Energy harvesting devices operate without batteries, salvaging energy from the environment to perform computation. However, they need to time to recharge themselves after they run out of energy and hence this could cause any program running on these devices to restart entirely, wasting all progress. My current research is associated with allowing these devices to store state in memory to that when they come back on, they don't have to restart the program entirely. 

General Interests
